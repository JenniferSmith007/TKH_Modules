What is Git and how is it different than Github 
		
		Git is a version control system, git helps to organize folders and files that have edited or changed code saved to them. Git also aids in tracking code changes over time, and makes it accessible for more than one person to work a set of code. Git has branches included into the program, the master branch is the branch that will publish finished work on to the internet.

Why use the terminal 
	
	Terminal is beneficial to use when creating proper folder structure, terminal is linked directly to the computer, just open the terminal from your project page no need to go to desktop to create folders. Terminal works on set of commands, it’s faster and can set up files into folders and folders into folders efficiently. Terminal can also list the contents into the folder a person is looking into, and download a file with out a browser. It’s just helpful when wanting to communicate to the computer faster and in depth.

Explain 3 benefits version control in your own words
	
	one benefit of version control, when collaborating on projects using git lets there be a precise track on who edited what line of code. Tracking who changed what or what line of code was change will be beneficial when it comes to debugging. Second benefit of version control is folder and file structure, it becomes easily readable by everyone who’s collaborating on the project. Using git, the folder structure is listed on on the terminal just have to access it by commands, from there everyone can see what’s inside the directory folder and sub folders from there, instead of using desktop or sharing screens. Third benefit of version control, is that holds all forms of the project so if you had to update software git has the code already there and you just build on top, or if there’s bugs in the old software go on git debug and then improve the software.
